# Furniture-Store

# TEAM NAME : (Online Home Furnishing | Mini-Project 2)

# Background Of The project:

The online home furnishing project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for customers to purchase furniture and home decor items through an online platform. Consumers seeking to decorate and enhance their living spaces. However, traditional brick-and-mortar furniture stores often have limited inventory and can be inconvenient for customers to visit, especially for those with busy schedules or limited mobility.

To address these challenges, the online home furnishing project proposes to create a user-friendly website that offers a wide range of furniture and decor items that customers can browse and purchase from the comfort of their homes. The website will feature detailed product descriptions and images, as well as customer reviews and ratings to help shoppers make informed purchasing decisions.

To ensure customer satisfaction, the project team will partner with reputable furniture manufacturers and suppliers to provide high-quality and affordable products. Additionally, the project will offer various delivery options to cater to different customer needs, including home delivery and in-store pickup.

The online home furnishing project aims to differentiate itself from other online furniture retailers by providing personalized customer service and expert advice through its online chat and phone support. Customers will be able to ask questions and receive recommendations from knowledgeable home decor specialists who can help them create the perfect look for their home.
